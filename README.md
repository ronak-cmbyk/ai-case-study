# UNLEARN.AI

* Unlearn.Ai was founded in 2017 by former Pfizer principal scientist Charles Fischer. Unlearn.Ai began as a company dedicated to minimizing the use of patients in placebo trial studies in medicine by using artificial digital twin studies using generative machine learning modelling to faster forecast the viabillity of drugs developed by biopharmaceutical companies. As a smaller, more recent organizaiton, Unlearn.AI is currently a Series A & C funded company that has received $50 million in funding via Coinbase.


* "...we are harnessing AI to tackle some of the biggest bottlenecks in clinical development: long trial timelines, high costs, and uncertain outcomes. " &ndash; Unlearn.Ai, 2024

## Business Activities

* Unlearn. Ai is focused on using artificial intelligence technology to reduce the costliness and length of clinical drug research trials. The company's intended customers are companies that produce biopharmaceutical drugs, which has a current market size of $571.84 billion! While a majority of the current global market share is in North America, there is growth in Asia and Australia, from reduced clinical trial costs and larger population sizes. Unlearn.Ai utilizes machine learning models by creating "digital twins" to determine patient outcomes for biopharmaceuticals to circumvent the large cost and long length of current research trials for biopharmaceuticals. Currently, Unlearn.AI utilizes generative machine learning modelling that incorporates patient data from previous research studies to create "digital twin" copies. These "digital twins" are input into an artificial generator titled Digital Twin Generator to create digital predicted patient outcomes. These files are downloadable on their website for drug trial researchers to access through a survey.

* "Our novel AI models analyze vast quantities of patient-level data, which we call their digital twins, to forecast patientsâ€™ health outcomes. By integrating digital twins into clinical trials, we are able to accelerate clinical research and help bring life-saving new treatments to patients in need." &ndash; Open.Ai, 2024

## Landscape

* Unlearn.Ai is a company in the biotechnology industry. Artificial intelligence has become a large part of the current field of biotechnology after data from studies through the technology's capability to quickly analyze large data sets to identify effective treatments. With much of data becoming available via online access, the field has grown exponentially. Additionally, genetic sequencing has become a growing focus as it enables more personalized therapy. Major companies include Novo Nordisk, Moderna, BioNTech, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, and Vertex. Major companies include Novo Nordisk, Moderna, BioNTech, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, and Vertex.

* "In the realm of Biotechnology, a vast amount of data is now accessible, thanks to the expansion of omics technologies and the integration of sensors and IoT devices." &ndash; StartUp Insights

## Results

* As a newer company, Unlearn.AI has secured much interest and buzz in the biotechnology industry, and is on track to have huge impact. Funding has been a large tool to measure the success of Unlearn.Ai. Based on the recency of the company's foundation, Unlearn.Ai has been performing well already securing $50 million in funding. Compared to other medical artificial intelligence , Unlearn.Ai has not performed as well as it is a relatively new company.

* "The funding Unlearn raised came after it won approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in September for using its AI-driven approach for conducting smaller and quicker clinical trials and struck several multi-million dollar deals with pharmaceutical companies, including Merck." &ndash; Reuters, 2023

## Recommendations

* For Unlearn.Ai, I would suggest to incorporate usage of other data sets similar to their concept of "digital twins" to create more generators to aid in treatment for more personalized therapies. This would benefit the company by enabling a larger client base by utilizing their knowledge of AI to create more personalized treatments, which is a current area of interest within the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals industry. Additional technologies for this additional product would utilize two-dimensional motion-sensing scan technology to identify specific disorders with physical symptoms. This addition would utilize the generative machine learning models that Unlearn.Ai that has already created. It has the potential to be immplemented in gene therapy to combat specific muscular and psychtriatic disorders.
