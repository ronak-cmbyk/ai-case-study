## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Unlearn. Ai is focused on using artificial intelligence technology to reduce the costliness and length of clinical drug research trials. 

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
The company's intended customers are companies that produce biopharmaceutical drugs, which has a current market size of $571.84 billion! While a majority of the current global market share is in North America, there is growth in Asia and Australia, from reduced clinical trial costs and larger population sizes. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Unlearn.Ai utilizes machine learning models by creating "digital twins" to determine patient outcomes for biopharmaceuticals to circumvent the large cost and long length of current research trials for biopharmaceuticals.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Currently, Unlearn.AI utilizes generative machine learning modelling that incorporates patient data from previous research studies to create "digital twin" copies. These "digital twins" are input into an artificial generator titled Digital Twin Generator to create digital predicted patient outcomes. These files are downloadable on their website for drug trial researchers to access through a survey.
