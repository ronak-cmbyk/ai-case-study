# TITLE

## Overview and Origin

Name of company
*Unlearn.Ai
* When was the company incorporated?
Unlearn.Ai was founded in 2017 by former Pfizer principal scientist Charles Fischer.
* Who are the founders of the company?

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
Unlearn.Ai began as a company dedicated to minimizing the use of patients in placebo trial studies in medicine by using artificial digital twin studies using generative machine learning modelling to faster forecast the viabillity of drugs developed by biopharmaceutical companies.
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
As a smaller, more recent organizaiton, Unlearn.AI is currently a Series A & C funded company that has received $50 million in funding via Coinbase.

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Unlearn. Ai is focused on using artificial intelligence technology to reduce the costliness and length of clinical drug research trials. 

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
The company's intended customers are companies that produce biopharmaceutical drugs, which has a current market size of $571.84 billion! While a majority of the current global market share is in North America, there is growth in Asia and Australia, from reduced clinical trial costs and larger population sizes. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Unlearn.Ai utilizes machine learning models by creating "digital twins" to determine patient outcomes for biopharmaceuticals to circumvent the large cost and long length of current research trials for biopharmaceuticals.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Currently, Unlearn.AI utilizes generative machine learning modelling that incorporates patient data from previous research studies to create "digital twin" copies. These "digital twins" are input into an artificial generator titled Digital Twin Generator to create digital predicted patient outcomes. These files are downloadable on their website for drug trial researchers to access through a survey.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

For Unlearn.Ai, I would suggest to incorporate usage of other data sets similar to their concept of "digital twins" to create more generators to aid in treatment for more personalized therapies.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

This would benefit the company by enabling a larger client base by utilizing their knowledge of AI to create more personalized treatments, which is a current area of interest within the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals industry.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Additional technologies for this additional product would utilize two-dimensional motion-sensing scan technology to identify specific disorders with physical symptoms.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
This addition would utilize the generative machine learning models that Unlearn.Ai that has already created. It has the potential to be immplemented in gene therapy to combat specific muscular and psychtriatic disorders.
